# Google Photos Dark Mode

There is currently no dark mode in Google Photos.  They just recently introduced this into Google Chat.

Just install this script with tampermonkey.  Customize the styles as you see fit, there isn't much to change.

Current colors settings:
- `top bar`: **black**
- `background for main page & side bar`: **#252525**
- `Font color changes`:**#dddddd**
